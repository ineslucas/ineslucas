### Hi there 👋🏼

Entrepreneurship enthusiast and full stack developer based in NYC, currently a grad student in Interactive Telecommunications (ITP) at NYU 🗽�

🧠 My curiosity led me to various sectors - tech, public sector, finance, social impact consulting, FMCG and student focused services across 7 countries.

🏄‍♀️ Built Surf the Job, a youth employment and upskilling focused start-up.

🛠️ Social Impact and advocacy is at the center of my practice. Fell in love with creating delightful and socially conscious web experiences so transitioned into Full Stack Development and have since worked as a developer for Unbabel with the Center for Responsible AI and NYU on a climate research project.

🇪🇺 My time at the European Investment Fund was a perfect blend of creative work, project management, EU policy, Venture Capital, SME financing and how to craft stories. It prepared me to develop meaningful products in a structured way.

🌎  I've spent most of my life volunteering, having collaborated with the European Commission, Generation Climate Europe, lived in a self-sustaining eco-community contributing through marketing in the Netherlands and I've led a workshop on storytelling for young people working in public policy in Belgium.
