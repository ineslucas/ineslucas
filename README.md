### Hi there 👋🏼

I'm an entrepreneurship enthusiast turned Full Stack Developer working at Unbabel and studying Interactive Telecommunications at NYU, with 2 years of experience in Marketing at the European Investment Fund, the EU body financing startups and small businesses 🇪🇺 

🧠 My curiosity led me to various sectors - 2 years of experience in public sector (EU), finance, social impact consulting, FMCG and student focused services. 👩🏻‍💻 My experience at the EU was hands-on, encompassing creative work, project management, EU policy, Venture Capital, SME financing and how to craft stories.

🏄‍♀️ Built Surf the Job, a youth employment and upskilling focused start-up with no-code.

🛠️ Fell in love with building so I learnt proper Full Stack Development  by completing a Le Wagon bootcamp, where I learnt Ruby on Rails, Git, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, SQL, Figma.

🌍 Currently based in Lisbon - moving to New York City soon. Previously Luxembourg, Norway, Canada, Thailand and Netherlands. 

🗣️ Passionate about what makes people tick, which led me to seek multicultural environments and study languages to connect with different cultures, such as German and Spanish. I'm into alternative and self-sustaining ways of living: lived in a self-sustaining community contributing through marketing/sales. 

🎙 Sharing insights from my journey in EU comms, I led a storytelling workshop in Belgium!

I'm excited to develop my skills in creative technology and full stack development. Also always up to chat about Social Innovation, Entrepreneurship, Neuroscience and beyond. Education and financial literacy are also topics dear to me.
